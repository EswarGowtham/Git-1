1. Hoisting in JavaScript is a process in which all the Variables, Functions and Class defination are declared BEFORE execution of the code 
3. Variables are initialised to UNDEFINED when they are declared and Function defination is stored AS IT IS.
4. They are declared in Memory Allocation Phase in the Memory Component of Execution Context, so we can use them even BEFORE they are declared.
5. UNDEFINED means Variable has been declared but value is not ASSIGNED but NOT DEFINED means Variables is NOT DECLARED.

Lexical: when you declare a variable inside a function or a block of code, that variable is accessible only within that function or block and any nested functions or blocks within it. The scope of a variable is determined by where it is written in the code
